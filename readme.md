# Jekyll Image Tag

**Better images for Jekyll.**

Jekyll Image Tag is a full featured liquid tag for images in the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) static site generator. Store image presets, add classes, alt text, and any other attribute to an image's HTML, and automatically create resized images from a tag argument or a little YAML configuration.

For responsive images in Jekyll, take a look at [Jekyll Picture Tag](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/jekyll-picture-tag).

## Semi-deprecated

I'm not working on many jekyll projects anymore, so have no reason to use this code. If you find this code useful feel free to ping me and I'll hand the repo over to you.

## Installation

Jekyll Image Tag requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) `>=1.0`, [Minimagick](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) `>=3.6`, and [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

Once you have the requirements installed, copy image_tag.rb into your Jekyll _plugins folder.

## Usage

There are two parts to Jekyll Image Tag: 

- [Liquid Tag](#liquid-tag)
- [HTML Tag](#html-tag)
- [Configuration](#configuration)

### Liquid Tag
With the auto tag this will run the liquid tag like the original plugin.
```
{% image auto [preset or WxH] path/to/img.jpg [attr="value"] %}
```
Prints as:
```html
<img src="path/to/generated/img.jpg" attr="value">
```
The tag takes a mix of user input and pointers to configuration settings.

### HTML Tag
Without the auto tag, this plugin will simply spit out the generated url with no additional attributes.
```
<img src="{% image [preset or WxH] path/to/img.jpg %}"> %}
```
Prints as:
```html
<img src="path/to/generated/img.jpg">
```


#### image

Tells Liquid this is a Jekyll Image Tag.

#### preset or WxH

Optionally specify a [preset](#presets) or image dimensions. Leave blank to use the image as is.

A preset will resize the image based on the preset's width and height properties, and add any preset attributes to the image's HTML.

Image dimensions follow the format `WIDTHxHEIGHT`. Each dimension can be either a number of pixels or the keyword `AUTO`. If one dimension is `AUTO` the image will scale proportionately. Two numbers will scale and crop.

#### path/to/img.jpg

The base image. Can be a jpeg, png, or gif.

#### attribute="value"

Optionally specify any number of HTML attributes. These will be merged with any [attributes you've set in a preset](#attr). An attribute set in a tag will override the same attribute set in a preset.

### Configuration

Jekyll Image Tag stores settings in an `image` key in your _config.yml.

**Example settings**

```yml
image:
  source: assets/images/_fullsize
  output: generated
  presets:
    users:
      attr:
        class: user-portrait
        itemprop: image
      width: 350
    half:
      width: 400
      height: 400
```

#### source

To make writing tags easier you can specify a source directory for your assets. Base images in the tag will be relative to the `source` directory. 

For example, if `source` is set to `assets/images/_fullsize`, the tag `{% image stevenson/dream.jpg alt="A night scene" %}` will look for a file at `assets/images/_fullsize/stevenson/dream.jpg`.

Defaults to the site source directory.

#### output

Jekyll Image Tag generates resized images to the `output` directory in your compiled site. The organization of your `source` directory is maintained in the output directory. 

Defaults to `{compiled Jekyll site}/generated`.

*__NOTE:__ `output` must be in a directory that contains other files or it will be erased. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/1297) in Jekyll.*

#### presets

Presets contain reusable settings for a Jekyll Image Tag. 

For example, a `users` preset might set image dimensions, a class, and some metadata attributes needed for all user pictures. If the design changes, you can edit the `users` preset and the new settings will apply to every tag that references it.

A preset name can't contain the `.`, `:`, or `/` characters.

#### attr

Optionally add a list of html attributes to insert when the preset is used.

Set the value of standalone attributes to `nil`.

An attribute set in a tag will override the same attribute set in a preset.

#### width and height

The same as [width and height](#preset-or-wxh) at the tag level, except that dimensions with an `AUTO` value are omitted. Set a single value to scale the image proportionately. Set both to scale and crop.

## Using Liquid variables and JavaScript templating

You can use liquid variables in an image tag:

```html
{% image {{ post.featured_image }} alt="our project" %}
```

If you're using a JavaScript templating library such as Handlebars.js, the templating expression's opening braces must be escaped with backslashes like `\{\{` or `\{\%`. They'll be output as normal `{{ }}` expressions in HTML:

```
{% image {{ post.featured_image }} alt="\{\{ user_name }}" %}.
```

## Managing Generated Images

Jekyll Image Tag creates resized versions of your images when you build the site. It uses a smart caching system to speed up site compilation, and re-uses images as much as possible.

Try to use a base image that is larger than the largest resized image you need. Jekyll Image Tag will warn you if a base image is too small, and won't upscale images.

By using a `source` directory that is ignored by Jekyll you can prevent huge base images from being copied to the compiled site. For example, `source: assets/images/_fullsize` and `output: generated` will result in a compiled site that contains resized images but not the originals.

The `output` directory is never deleted by Jekyll. You may want to manually clean it every once in a while to remove unused images.

Resizing images is a good first step to improve performance, but you should still use a build process to optimize site assets before deploying. If you're a cool kid, take a look at the [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for Jekyll, [generator-jekyllrb](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb).
